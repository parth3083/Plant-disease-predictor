<br>
<br>
This project implements a plant disease prediction system using a combination of technologies:
<br>
<br>
•	Machine Learning (ML) with Python: A PyTorch model is trained to identify plant diseases from images.
<br>
•	Express.js Backend: Handles API requests and processes image uploads.
<br>
•	EJS Templates for Frontend: Renders dynamic content based on user interaction.
<br>
•	UUID for Unique File Names: Ensures secure and organized image storage.
<br>
•	Child Process Spawning: Connects the backend to the Python script for prediction.
<br>
<br>
Key Features:
<br>
•	Accurately predicts plant diseases using ML.
<br>
•	User-friendly web interface for uploading images and receiving results.
<br>
•	Secure image storage with unique identifiers.
<br>
•	Efficient communication between backend and Python model.
<br>
<br>
Technology Stack:
<br>
•	Python, PyTorch
<br>
•	Express.js, EJS
<br>
•	UUID
<br>
•	Child Process
<br>
<br>
Potential Applications:
<br>
•	Agriculture, farming assistance
<br>
•	Early disease detection for plants
<br>
•	Research and development in plant health
<br>
<br>
Next Steps:
<br>
•	Enhance model accuracy and expand disease coverage.
<br>
•	Improve user interface and user experience.
<br>
•	Explore cloud deployment and scalability.
<br>
<br>
Overall, this project demonstrates a innovative approach to plant disease prediction using a combination of ML, web development, and data management techniques.
